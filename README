RestfulViews
============

RestfulViews contains helpers to make your views more consistent by setting default CSS classes, defining standard labels, etc.

Comments, patches, ideas, etc. are very welcome at: restfulviews at larssehested dot com.


Example
=======

There are 5 methods available at the moment: index_link, show_link, new_link, edit_link and destroy_link.

You can call all methods using either an instance of the object you want to link to (e.g. show_link(post)) or a symbol or (if applicable) an ID (e.g. show_link(:post, 3)).

Example:

  <% index_link(post) %>

will render:

  <a href="/posts" class="post index index_post">Show all</a>


Thanks to
